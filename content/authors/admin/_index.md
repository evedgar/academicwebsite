I am a postdoctoral research associate working with Lorraine E. Bahrick in the Infant Development Lab at Florida International University. I completed my Ph.D. in 2021 under the supervison of Lorraine E. Bahrick at Florida International University. 

Broadly, I am a developmental scientist interested in how basic, early developing attention skills build and cascade into later, more complex skills. My research embraces dynamic systems theory.
